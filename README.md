# Tic Tac Toe

A new Flutter project.

:sparkles: We have made a simple little game of Tic tac toe in flutter as a project to explain programming paradigms! 

`Instructions for use:`

*Note: remember to have at least the VSC extensions to run code in flutter and dart*.

- Go to the pubspec.yaml file and get the dependencies.
- Set up an emulator
- Start the debug session to install the application. 
- You are done!
